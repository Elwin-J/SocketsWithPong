# SocketsWithPong
## This repository contains an implementation of 2-player pong using socket connections to allow multiplayer Pong playing.
### To set up you'll firstly need python, pip and the following python libraries (some of which may already be installed):

<ul>
    <li> pygame </li>
    <li> socket </li>
    <li> json </li>
    <li> atexit </li>
    <li> threading </li>
    
</ul>

### To install these libraries, type in: <code> pip install &lt; module-name &gt; </code>

#### Note: Sometimes the client maybe unable to connect to the server due to firewall/other issues so firewall *may* need to be turned off on the server to play the game. Also make sure both players are on the same LAN for it to work correctly.
